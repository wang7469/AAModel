# asset_alocation_model
The main propose for this research project is to explore topic in data science via an application in financial portfolio management. I focus on applying the optimization method
to the investment asset allocation process. More specifically, I conducted an in-depth study of a previous work, including its mathematical methods and the data processing algorithm, and then implemented the algorithm for investment portfolio management in Python based on the work with one improvement that helps reduce the workload of getting inverse.

## usage
The implementation of the investment asset allocation model read a list of company tickers from a csv file, computing price changes over a certain period of time(form x_t to p_t), the model computes a suggested investment strategy at time p_t+1.

## future works
An additional investment software could be invented to work along with this model, which serves as an automatic asset investment tool using the results of the model.
