# asset_alocation_model
The main propose for this research project is to explore topic in data science via an application in financial portfolio management. I focus on applying the optimization method
to the investment asset allocation process. More specifically, I conducted an in-depth study of a previous work, including its mathematical methods and the data processing algorithm, and then
implemented the algorithm for investment portfolio management in Python based on the work with one improvement that helps reduce the workload of getting inverse.

## usage

## future works
An additional investment software could be invented to work along with this model, which serves as an automatic asset investment tool using the results of the model.
